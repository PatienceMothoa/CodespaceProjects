<h3>Software Development at <a href="http://codespace.co.za/">CodeSpace Academy</a></h3>
<p>
    Students learn how to create functional, dynamic web applications. They use HTML, CSS, Javascript, PhP, and MySQL to fast-track our career as a full-stack developer. It is a six months course.
</p>
<h3>Metallurgical Engineering at <a href="http://wits.ac.za/">University of the Witwatersrand</a></h3>
<p>
    Metallurgy and Materials Engineering involves the engineering principles required to concentrate, extract, refine metals, materials, and carbon(coal) materials, as well as to develop new alloys and materials, including ceramics and composites. Core subjects in Materials Engineering focus on the structure and behaviour of materials and their conversion into usable forms (through heat treatment, welding and forming processes, and powder metallurgy).

<h3>Promoter</h3>
<p>
    Instore promotion for Ariel washing powder campaign done over weekends. As promoters we wore asigned uniform and stood next to the product we were promoting. We had to prepare our working station where we will be doing demonstartions for consumers to illustrate why Ariel washing powder is better than competitors. We also had to record number of sales that were made per day.
</p>
<h3>Vacation student</h3>
<p>
    Metallurgy vacation student working with Prof Josias Van Der Merwe. We were doing corrosion tests on aluminium metal samples produced from 3D printing with the aim of studying the effects of 3D printing on the metal and doing comparisons to conclude whether 3D printing method is the efficient method to use.
